# push-state.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook (loopd machinery).
#
# Pushes one compact line of CURRENT instance state into context on every turn.
#
# WHY EVERY TURN, when the PM is already told to read the bundle. "Told to read"
# is not "always knows". `/<plugin>:dispatch` is a long-lived session: after several ticks
# its context still describes the world as it stood at tick one — dispatches that
# have since finished, questions since answered, a project since closed. The
# loop's rule that "the tick's task-notification is the only valid finished
# signal" exists because exactly that drift already bit. A stale roster in
# context is not corrected by an instruction to re-read; it is corrected by a
# NEWER STATEMENT of the truth, so this states it, and says out loud that it
# supersedes whatever came before.
#
# SELF-DETECTING. It prints nothing at all unless the root looks like a
# control-panel instance — `instance.config.json`, the same one marker every other
# reader uses. (`SCHEMA.md` and `.claude/agents` were the other two of a triple;
# both are machinery paths this migration moves or retires, so keying on either
# would silence this in every instance.) So it is safe to
# inherit in any non-bridge project, and safe to run from anywhere.
#
# INSIDE an instance it always prints, zeros included. "in-flight 0" is precisely
# the correction a conversation that still remembers three live dispatches needs;
# suppressing the quiet case would leave the loudest stale claim standing.
#
# CAPPED, AND IT SAYS WHAT IT DROPPED. This lands in context on every single
# prompt, so an injection that grows with the bundle is worse than the drift it
# fixes. Each list is capped (`PUSH_STATE_MAX`, default 12) and reports the count
# it did not list. Ids and slugs only — never task `title:` prose, which would
# multiply the per-turn cost for no correlation value.
#
# FENCED AS DATA. The text is derived from the bundle's own paths and frontmatter.
# A project slug or task id is still human-authored text sitting beside this
# hook's own closing instruction, so it is fenced and labelled, exactly as
# `session-banner.sh` fences its items.
#
# DELIBERATELY SELF-CONTAINED: it derives everything from the bundle on each run
# and depends on no generated snapshot file. Bash + find + awk only, no jq.
#
# Verified by tests/push-state.test.sh.

# NORMALISED TO BASE 10 BEFORE ANY ARITHMETIC. The digit check below accepts a
# leading zero, and bash then reads `08` as OCTAL — where 8 is not a legal digit.
# `PUSH_STATE_MAX=08` therefore reached `$((inflight_n-MAX))` and bash printed
# "value too great for base" to stderr on every prompt, while the `(+N not
# listed)` suffix silently vanished: the cap truncated the list and stopped
# saying so, which is the one property the cap exists to guarantee. `010` was
# worse for being quiet — a clean octal 8, so a user asking for ten got eight
# with no warning at all. `10#` is preferred over rejecting leading zeros
# because it honours the intent of every all-digit value instead of discarding
# it for the default, and normalising ONCE here means no arithmetic site
# downstream can reintroduce the bug. Order matters: the digit check runs first
# (so `10#` always gets a non-empty all-digit string), and the `-gt 0` test runs
# last (so it sees the normalised value and catches a 0 or an overflow wrap).

# Read the FIRST `status:` out of each file's frontmatter, in ONE awk process
# rather than one grep per file — this runs on every prompt, so the process count
# is the cost that matters. Stops at the closing `---`, so a body line reading
# `status: ...` is never mistaken for one.
#
# `got` is what makes "first" true, and it is reset per file in the FNR==1 block.
# Without it the rule printed EVERY match, so a document with a repeated
# `status:` emitted two records: its id was listed twice and the count
# double-incremented, and the *later* value decided the classification — a task
# reading `status: done` then `status: in-progress` was reported in flight. A
# malformed document must not be able to inflate the roster this hook then
# claims supersedes the true one.
#
# ENCODED TO ONE LINE, AND THAT IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY, not tidiness. Every
# value this hook injects (project slug, task id, phase stem) is a *filename*,
# and both macOS and Linux permit a newline, a carriage return and a tab inside
# one. All three arrived raw, and each broke something different:
#
#   · A CR passed straight through into the fenced block, so a directory named
#     `evil<CR>--- END INSTANCE STATE ---` printed that closing marker as its own
#     line to any reader that honours CR as a break. Everything after it —
#     including this hook's own closing instruction — then sat OUTSIDE the
#     untrusted-data boundary the fence exists to establish. Bundle-authored text
#     must never be able to forge either marker.
#   · An LF split one awk record in two, so the read loops below saw a headless
#     fragment: a project named `mmm<LF>qqq` was reported as `qqq`. Worse, when
#     the surviving fragment began with `-`, `basename` option-parsed it and the
#     hook printed nothing but a usage error — the entire state injection lost.
#   · A TAB collided with the field separator, so the record's status never
#     matched and the project AND its in-flight tasks vanished from the counts:
#     `active projects 1` with two active on disk. That is the silent false zero
#     this file's header calls the worst thing it can emit.
#
# awk is the SINGLE choke point where file-derived text becomes one line, because
# it is the only place any of that text enters. That is deliberate: one place
# cannot be forgotten, and it keeps the property testable — do NOT add a second
# sanitising pass over the assembled line, which would mask exactly the
# regression push-state.test.sh watches for. The item is still SURFACED, never
# dropped (the same rule awaiting-queue.test.sh asserts): a slug you cannot see
# is a slug you cannot fix. The encoding is intentionally lossy rather than
# reversible — `\n` as text and a real newline collapse together — since the
# property that matters is "one line, no control characters", not round-tripping.
# One accepted consequence: for such a pathological directory the encoded path no
# longer resolves on disk, so its active phase is not found and the slug prints
# without the `(phase …)` suffix. Degrading there beats leaking a raw control
# character, and the project itself is still counted and named.
