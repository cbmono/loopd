# link-repos.sh — refresh `repos/`, a symlink-per-repo view of reposRoot inside
# this instance.
#
# The control panel and the product repos are PHYSICAL PEERS on disk: the instance
# is never a parent of a repo, because nesting would drag its control-panel
# CLAUDE.md into the cascade of every product-repo session. This gives you the
# convenience of the nested layout without the nesting — one symlink per repo under
# `repos/`, so `ls repos/`, `cd repos/<name>` and editors that open only ONE folder
# all reach the group's repos from inside the instance.
#
# It is a VIEW, not a work location. Role agents still work in their own worktree
# under <reposRoot>/_wt/ (see the project-manager agent), and `repos/` is
# gitignored — the bundle stamp manages that line.
#
# WHAT GETS LINKED: every directory directly under `reposRoot` that contains a
# `.git` and whose name does NOT start with `_`. That one underscore rule skips
# both sibling instances (`_ai-bridge-<group>`) and the worktree root (`_wt`), so
# the view never fills with transient agent worktrees. The instance that holds the
# view is skipped by resolved path as well, whatever it is named — a link back to
# it would make `repos/<instance>/repos/...` recurse forever.
#
# Idempotent and self-pruning: a link whose target is gone, or is no longer a git
# repo, is removed. It only ever creates, replaces or removes SYMLINKS inside
# `repos/`; a real file or directory there is reported and left alone.
#
# Run from a control-panel instance root (reads `reposRoot` from
# instance.config.json). `--remove` is the one mode that needs neither, so a
# half-torn-down instance can still be cleaned up. Generic: no org/repo/path
# literals.
#
# Usage:  link-repos.sh [--dry-run|-n] [--remove]
#           --remove   delete the links and the (then empty) repos/ dir
set -euo pipefail
# dotglob as well as nullglob: a repo name may legitimately start with a dot (an
# org's `.github` repo is the common one), and without it such a clone is invisible
# to all three loops — never linked, and an existing link never pruned or removed.
# Neither option makes `*` match `.` or `..`, and the `.git` requirement below
# still filters out dot-directories that aren't repos.
