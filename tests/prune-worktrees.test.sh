#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Exercises plugin/scripts/prune-worktrees.sh — the worktree CLASSIFIER.
# It is report-only since v2: it never removes, it prints commands.
#
# The pruner is the one script in this template that can destroy work, and it has
# done so (three running agents' worktrees, 2026-08-04). It has no safe manual
# test: exercising it by hand means pointing it at real worktrees. So this harness
# builds a throwaway git repo with one worktree per decision class, runs the
# pruner with --dry-run against it, and asserts the decision for every case.
#
# Properties it guarantees, and which any change to the pruner must preserve:
#   1. It never touches the real reposRoot. It builds its own instance dir with
#      its own instance.config.json pointing at a mktemp tree, and asserts every
#      scan root the pruner reports is inside that tree.
#   2. It builds OUTSIDE any synced folder, and refuses to run if $TMPDIR is
#      inside one — a Dropbox-backed fixture can have its files rewritten
#      mid-run (see the dropbox-backed-worktrees finding in the instance KB).
#   3. It runs the pruner with --dry-run only. Nothing is ever removed.
#   4. NO detached-HEAD worktree is ever reported REMOVABLE, with any flags.
#      This is asserted as a blanket property over the whole matrix, not just
#      per case, because that is the class whose commits removal destroys with
#      no ref left pointing at them.
#   5. NO worktree holding untracked scaffolding is ever auto-removed. Also a
#      blanket property: the scaffolding allowlist is a name heuristic, and the
#      thing that bounds its blast radius to a report line is precisely that a
#      recognised name can never reach REMOVE on its own.
#   6. NO worktree with zero commits of its own is ever removed, under any flag.
#      That is a fresh dispatch — the shape that destroyed three running agents'
#      worktrees on 2026-08-04 — and it stays that shape as its base goes stale.
#   7. The zero-commit guard's POSITION in the decision chain is pinned, not just
#      its existence. A guard that exists to pre-empt a later test cannot be
#      detected by any fixture that reaches KEEP through that later test, so
#      moving it is invisible to the rest of this matrix while re-arming the
#      original bug. `branch-recycled-name` is the fixture that sees the move.
#
# `gh` is stubbed (a fake `gh` first on PATH) so PR state is a fixture rather
# than a live network call. The stub answers the two invocations the pruner
# makes; it exits non-zero on any other, so a new gh call shows up as a failure
# instead of silently degrading to "no PR".
#
# Usage:  tests/prune-worktrees.test.sh

#         SHOW_ONLY=1 tests/prune-worktrees.test.sh   # run, no asserts
#
# SHOW_ONLY prints the raw pruner output for every fixture without asserting. It
# is how you see what a given version of the pruner decides — including an older
# one via PRUNER= — which is what established that the pre-fix script's
# detached-HEAD handling was a false negative rather than a false positive.

#     minutes ago. Every other fixture reaches KEEP through a LATER test than the
#     zero-commit guard, so demoting the guard into the `none|unknown` arm — which
#     is where it reads more naturally — changes NO other assertion here while
#     turning a live dispatch into `WOULD REMOVE (pr merged)`: the 2026-08-04 bug,
#     reintroduced silently. This fixture is the only one that sees the move, and
